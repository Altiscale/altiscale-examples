# altiscale-examples
A place to store all open source project's examples from Altiscale

Directory structure follows the hierarchy and naming convention
`apache-application-examples/`
or
`apache-application-examples/component/`

The components depends on the examples, and whether it makes sense to break it down 
to components. Use your best judgement.

Take Hive for example,
apache-hive-examples

For YARN application examples,
apache-yarn-examples
